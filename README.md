# Credit_Scoring_Models
so in this project we have compared four different machine learning models
1) Developed credit scoring models using machine learning techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, MLP Neural Network, and Logistic Regression.
2) We have analyzed the model performance based on accuracy and ROC curve, identifying Random Forest as the most accurate model.
3) Based on the performance Random Forest was the best model and using Random Forest we have designed a website
